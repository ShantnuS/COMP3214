### Part 1 ###  
Part 1 of the lab (on 7th March 2018) involved implementing a new method of rendering a triangle which used [Pineda's edge algorithm](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/Papers/comp175-06-pineda.pdf).    
My implementation [can be see here](cw2/Lab1/rgl/Render.cpp).    
    
### Part 2 ###      
Part 2 of the lab (on 2nd May 2018) involved implementing a Z-Buffer and create a shaded cube using the Gouraud Shader.  
My implementation [can be seen here](cw2/Lab2/).   
  
    
Full specifications [are available here](res/spec/cw2.pdf).
