# COMP3214
OpenGL coursework for the graphics module!  

## Coursework 1 ## 
Draw things on OpenGL based on requirements in specification.  
  
[Source files here](cw1).  
     
### Controls: ###     
Press **A** to **D** keys for different screens, each displaying the items described below.    
Press **Up** and **Down** arrow keys for zooming in and out on the shapes.    
Press **Right** and **Left** arrow keys for changing direction of rotation where applicable.   
Press **L** to toggle light direction rotation.   
	
**A** = wire-frame sphere.   
**B** = shaded sphere.  
**C** = draw rocket and have animations.  
**D** = textured object.  
  
Full specifications [are available here](res/spec/cw1.pdf).    
  
  
## Coursework 2 ## 
Coursework 2 is lab based and involves drawing rendering different things using a Raspberry Pi.   
    
[Source files here](cw2).    
    
### Part 1 ###  
Part 1 of the lab (on 7th March 2018) involved implementing a new method of rendering a triangle which used [Pineda's edge algorithm](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/Papers/comp175-06-pineda.pdf).    
My implementation [can be see here](cw2/Lab1/rgl/Render.cpp). 
  
    
    
### Part 2 ###      
Part 2 of the lab (on 2nd May 2018) involved implementing a Z-Buffer and create a shaded cube using the Gouraud Shader.  
My implementation [can be seen here](cw2/Lab2/).   
  
    
Full specifications [are available here](res/spec/cw2.pdf).
  
## Coursework P ## 
Using the [Bullet Physics engine](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3).  
    
[Source files here](cwP).    
    
Full specifications [are available here](res/spec/cwp.pdf).
