## Coursework 2 ## 
Coursework 2 is lab based and involves drawing rendering different things using a Raspberry Pi. 
  
### Part 1 ###  
Part 1 of the lab (on 7th March 2018) involved implementing a new method of rendering a triangle which used [Pineda's edge algorithm](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/Papers/comp175-06-pineda.pdf).    
My implementation [can be see here](cw2/rgl/Render.cpp).
